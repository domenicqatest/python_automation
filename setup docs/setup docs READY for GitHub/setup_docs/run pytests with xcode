Running PyTests with Android Studio

What you’ll need:
iOS Driver
Xcode / iOS Simulator (see ‘android studio’ file for download info)
PyCharm (see ‘pycharm’ file for download info)

Getting iOS Driver

Download “0.6.6-SNAPSHOT”:
http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/?page=home

Create a folder labeled ‘jars’ in your PyCharm project folder.
Move the jar file to the ‘jars’ folder.

Xcode/iOS Simulator provides you with the different emulators.

Open PyCharm

Select an iOS test from your PyCharm project.

Make sure you have the driver set:
driver  = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.IPHONE)
or
driver  = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.IPHONE)

Terminal

In the PyCharm Terminal, connect to the iOS Driver server using this command:
java -jar jars/ios-server-standalone-0.6.6-SNAPSHOT.jar

Start a new session.

Run your pytest!
